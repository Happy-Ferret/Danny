# Danny
A peer-to-peer interactive-media tool, inspired by HyperCard, for Beaker/Dat Web APIs

## What it is
Danny is a thing that creates stacks, the only real way to describe the genre of software started by [HyperCard](https://hypercard.org/). Danny does not read or import HyperCard stacks themselves; Danny stacks are different in some important ways.

**No drawing tools.** When HyperCard was conceived in 1986, it took high-end, exotic technology to run two different applications at the same time. Now that it's more possible, the advantages of app specialization are such that it would be foolish not to do it. You'll just have to save web-format image files out of really good special-purpose image-creation tools, and drag them in to upload them. (You may find that most of your graphical needs, though, can be fulfilled by Elements, which may function as buttons, static text fields, fat or skinny boxes of solid color, or all of the above. They're the basic building block of Danny stacks.)

**No scripting.** Danny has a small but potentially quite productive set of assignable behaviors in a menu-driven system that isn't programming, but may remind you of it. (In the end, though, you just make sentences with it. It's not that hard.) We could have just let you write JavaScript, but A) that opens up trolling vectors, and B) if you *can* write JavaScript, well, you can already just write an app (the Danny code is easy to modify, by the way).

**Some CSS.** It may be helpful to know some of the formats of common CSS expressions, such as `200px` and `1.6rem`, to get things looking the way you want (especially since resizing things with the mouse is still kinda janky).

**Serverless, distributed multi-user stacks.** Coming soon.

## How to use
Maybe avoid it still. We'll update this document with a canonical Dat URL to fork from. (The only web browser we know of at the moment that supports the Dat protocol is [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com/). If that changes I will for sure let you know.)

## Danny?
Danny is named for [Danny Goodman](https://dannyg.com/), who set me on the path to doing this twice - the second time with his still-in-print *JavaScript Bible*. Thank you!
